# ChainLink
Python SDK for easily creating chatbot-based Gradio applications

## Installation

To install ChainLink, run the following command to install from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jacobrenn/chainlink
```

## Capabilities

ChainLink's capabilities are all focused around two classes - the `Model` class and the `App` class.

The `Model` class implements the ability to talk to a specific LLM/chatbot, while the `App` class implements the Gradio application around the specific `Model`.


**We are currently still working on building the implementation and documentation around ChainLink, so if you have any specific questions please feel free to reach out to us directly.**
